    // ... other fields
}

impl WorldEngine {
    pub async fn create_world(&self, name: String, width: u32, height: u32) -> Result<(), EngineError> {
        let world = self.generator.generate_world(name, width, height).await?;
        
        let mut current = self.current_world.write().await;
        *current = Some(world);
        
        Ok(())
    }
